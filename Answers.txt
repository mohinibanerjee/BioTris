Yes, humans directly evolved from chimpanzees.
***No, they both evolved from a common ancestor.
No, humans and chimpanzees have nothing in common.

Yes, of course. That's the point of hand sanitizer.
***No, 99.99% of the bacteria are killed - the fittest or strongest 0.01% survive and reproduce.
No, the fastest bacteria are able to escape.

***Short generation times.
Asexual reproduction.
Conjugation - transfering genetic information between several bacteria.

***Variation, inheritance, selection pressure, time.
Inheritance, mutations, adaptation.
Time, predators, changes in the environment.

The process of how nature randomly selects organisms to survive and reproduce.
The process of how humans choose which traits to be inherited.
***The process of how nature chooses the organisms with the most favorable traits to survive and reproduce - survival of the fittest.

***Genetic recombination(crossing over during meiosis).
Changes in the environment.
New organisms join the existing population.

Random: adaptation; Non-random: genetic equilibrium.
Random: selection pressures; Non-random: artifical selection.
***Random: genetic drift; Non-random: natural selection.

The different types of alleles in a population.
***The frequency of the different forms of a trait in a population.
The combined genetic information of all the organisms in a population.

Smaller populations tend to adjust their allele frequencies based on genetic drift.
Organisms can work together to prevent genetic drift from occuring. 
***Evolution is based on the laws of probability, which are more accurate in a large sample space.

A mathematician that came up with the laws of trignometry. 
A biologist who believed that populations were growing too rapidly.
***A biologist who believed that organisms had a tendency to be perfect.

***A change in the relative frequencies of alleles in a population's gene pool.
When genetic equilibrium occurs.
When the environmental conditions change, and natural selection selects a different favorable trait.

The gene pool of one population becomes "better" and it's survival/reproduction rate increases.
***Gene flow keeps the gene pool of neighboring populations similar, since alleles are being traded.
Gene flow will force the two populations to evolve differently.

Well developed cerebrum, fingers and toes.
Stereoscopic vision.
***Ability to read, write, think.

Stabalizing selection.
***Directional selection.
Disruptive selection.

Analogous structure.
Homologous structure.
***Vestigial structure.

***It is easier to absorb vitamin D since there is not many opportunities in the north to do so.
It evolved through a mutation.
Natural selection selected fair skin people to survive for no apparent reason. 

Founder's Effect.
Divergent evolution.
***Bottleneck Event.

They kill viruses.
***They kill bacteria.
They kill viruses and bacteria.

***There was a mutation for resistance that natural selection chose to survive and reproduce.
Through horizontal gene transfer, bacteria shared their genes and one of the results was a resistant trait.
Over time, bacteria adjusted their ways to be resistant to antibiotics.
